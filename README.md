I'm an Electrical Engineer currently learning Data Science, living in Curitiba, PR. Brazil. I've mastery in all stages of developing business solutions using the concepts and tools of Data Science. From understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds services.

I've already developed solutions for common business problems such as develop an online dashboard containing filters to select the best options for houses purchases with their expected profit and a solution for predicting the sales of a large chain of pharmacies.
The details of each solution are described in the projects bellow.
